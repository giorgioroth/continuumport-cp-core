  "intent": "Implement a real-time collaborative text editor with CRDT-based conflict resolution, cursor awareness, and offline-first behavior.",
  "constraints": [
    "Must function offline for up to 7 days with automatic synchronization on reconnection",
    "Bundle size under 150kB gzipped",
    "Support at least 50 concurrent editors per document",
    "No server-side persistent document storage"
  ],
  "decisions": [
    "Using Yjs as CRDT implementation",
    "WebRTC for peer-to-peer transport",
    "Quill.js as editor foundation",
    "IndexedDB for local persistence",
    "Cursor positions encoded as relative offsets"
  ],
  "state_summary": "Yjs document synchronization functional between peers. WebRTC signaling established. Cursor awareness implemented but inconsistent during rapid edits. Offline edit queue operational; reconnection after extended offline periods causes merge anomalies requiring investigation.",
  "progress": "blocked"
